# FallingBlocks


# CURRENT:
    # ADD WIN CONDITION

# Finished: 
    # SET SPAWN CONDITION AT THE START OF THE GAME


# For reset:
    # Reset to the last wave
    # I could make a "Game level" class
    # and then a wave level class
    # so when I want to reset the game, I just make a new instance of the wave level class 
    # For game Stats, I can make a temp one for each wave and when the player passes the wave, I just add them
